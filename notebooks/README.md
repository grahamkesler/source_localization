This folder contains simulation notebooks exploring source localization on infection tree networks.

## Notebooks

### 1. Observer Placement in Prufer Trees
`observer_placement_prufer_trees.ipynb`

- Trees generated via uniformly random Prufer sequences
- Compares multiple observer-selection strategies
- Evaluates performance by candidate source reduction

### 2. Observer Placement in Unlabeled Trees
`observer_placement_unlabeled.ipynb`

- Tree shapes sampled uniformly at random (unlabeled)
- Nodes labeled post-generation for simulation
- Examines how shape-uniform sampling affects results

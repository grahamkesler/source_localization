# Notebooks

This folder contains simulation notebooks exploring source localization on infection tree networks.

## Notebooks

### 1. Observer Placement in Prufer Trees
`observer_placement_prufer_trees.ipynb`

- Trees generated via uniformly random Prufer sequences
- Compares multiple observer-selection strategies
- Evaluates performance by candidate source reduction

### 2. Observer Placement in Unlabeled Trees
`observer_placement_unlabeled.ipynb`

- Tree shapes sampled uniformly at random (unlabeled)
- Nodes labeled post-generation for simulation
- Examines how shape-uniform sampling affects results

### 3. Tree Generation Distribution Comparison  
`prufer_unlabeled_comparison.ipynb`  

- Compares uniformly labeled (Prufer) and unlabeled random tree generators  
- Demonstrates differences in induced distributions over tree isomorphism classes  
- Quantifies divergence using structural statistics and Jensen–Shannon divergence

### 4. Infection Time Distribution on Triangle Network 
`triangle_infection.ipynb`  

- Simulates infection spreading on a simple triangle network
- Enumerates all possible infection trees given source and observer placements
- Compares empirical distributions of infection times across tree structures
